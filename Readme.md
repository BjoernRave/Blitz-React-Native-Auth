# Blitz with React Native

This is an example repo of how to setup auth on a react native app with Blitz.js

Some of the stuff is currently very opinionated and could be generalized to include it into the blitz repo.

Currently I have set `DANGEROUSLY_DISABLE_CSRF_PROTECTION=true`. It might be possible to make that work with react-native as well, though.

I took inspiration from this presentation: https://youtu.be/2joIg1hspIw?t=2342
